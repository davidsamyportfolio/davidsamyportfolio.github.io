    <p>Hi! My name is David Samy and I am in the 8th grade. I enjoy many hobbies and do many things outside of school. Firstly I play basketball for the California Bearcats Select and I have been playing for a few years. I really enjoy the thrill of sports. In addition I am also an active Boy Scout</p>

    <p><b>How broad is your friend group? Are peers easily accepted(within your group and/or outside of your group) ? <br>What have you done/can you do to improve the social atmosphere within your group of friends, grade-level, or school?</b><br><br>I am usually a very open person and expand my friend group. Peers are easily accepted in my friend group because me and my friends<br> are open to anyone coming and joining our friend group. To improve my social atmosphere of my school I try to talk to people and build friendships whenever I can. <br><br><b>How have you contributed to our community this year? Provide examples of any leadership roles you have assumed or how you have been a role model (these examples can be academic, social, or from extracurricullar activites). How have you grown as a leader/role model, or what are some ideas on how to assume these roles in the future?</b><br><br>I have led social studies projects and also projects from other subjects throughout the year and I have grown a lot and learnt more about what a leader is. In addition, I have participated in Casa De Amistad with the school once a month. I enjoy working with the kids and making sure they have a great learning expierience. I also assumed a leadership role on our Rhoades basketball team as a expreienced players I helped coach other players and help them out with their basketball skillsets.<br><br><b>Are you consistent with completing work on time? What is hindering/helping you?</b><br><br></p>
