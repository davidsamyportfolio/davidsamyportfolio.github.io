    <p>My artifact is the organization of my typed literature homework. My stretch was organization and this artifact addresses my organization. This is my artifact because previously I was unable to keep track of where I kept my assignments so I decided to switch everything online so I could make it more accessible. Now I can effortlessly go back and look at my assignments from the past two months.
